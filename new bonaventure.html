<P align="center">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps not a household name for most people, Saint Bonaventure, nevertheless, played an important role</br>
<br> in both the medieval Church and the history of the Franciscan Order. A senior faculty member at the University of Paris, Saint Bonaventure</br>
<br> certainly captured the hearts of his students through his academic skills and insights. But more importantly, he captured their hearts</br>
<br> through his Franciscan love for Jesus and the Church. A senior faculty member at the University of Paris, Saint Bonaventure certainly</br>
<br> captured the hearts of his students through his academic skills and insights. But more importantly, he captured their hearts through his</br>
<br> Franciscan love for Jesus and the Church. Like his model, Saint Francis, Jesus was the center of everything—his teaching, </br>
<br>his administration, his writing, and his life. So much so, that he was given the title “Seraphic Doctor.”</p>
<p align="center">
<br>Born in Bagnoregio in 1221, Saint Bonaventure was baptized John, but received the name Bonaventure when he became a Franciscan</br>
<br> at the age of 22. Little is known about his childhood, but we do know that his parents were Giovanni di Fidanza and Maria Ritell.</br>
<br> It seems that his father was a physician and a man of means. While Saint Francis died about five years after the saint’s birth, </br>
<br>he is credited with healing Bonaventure as a boy of a serious illness.</p>
<p align="center">
<br>Saint Bonaventure’s teaching career came to a halt when the Friars elected him to serve as their General Minister. His 17 years of</br>
<br> service were not easy as the Order was embroiled in conflicts over the interpretation of poverty. Some friars even ended up in heresy</br>
<br> saying that Saint Francis and his community were inaugurating the era of the Holy Spirit which was to replace Jesus, the Church,</br>
<br> and Scripture. But because he was a man of prayer and a good administrator, Saint Bonaventure managed to structure the Order through</br>
<br> effective legislation. But more importantly, he offered the Friars an organized spirituality based on the vision and insights of</br>
<br> Saint Francis. Always a Franciscan at heart and a mystical writer, Bonaventure managed to unite the pastoral, practical aspects</br>
<br>of life with the doctrines of the Church. Thus, there is a noticeable warmth to his teachings and writings that make him very appealing.</br>
<br>Shortly before he ended his service as General Minister, Pope Gregory X created him a Cardinal and appointed him bishop of Albano.</br> 
<br>But a little over a year later, while participating in the Second Council of Lyon, Saint Bonaventure died suddenly on July 15, 1274</br>
<br>. There is a theory that he was poisoned.Saint Bonaventure left behind a structured and renewed Franciscan Order and a body of work </br>
 <br>of work all of which glorifies his major love—Jesus. </p>
