<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Anthony of Padua was a renowned Franciscan preacher and teacher, best known as the patron saint of lost and stolen items. Born in 1195 in Lisbon, Portugal, he initially joined the Augustinian Order but later became a Franciscan after being inspired by the martyrdom of fellow Franciscans. Seeking to preach in Morocco, he fell ill and was instead redirected to Italy, where he lived a humble life of prayer and contemplation. His preaching abilities were discovered by chance, leading him to become a powerful evangelist, emphasizing genuine gospel living and poverty. He traveled extensively, spreading Christianity through heartfelt sermons rather than confrontation. His legacy remains strong due to his holiness, humility, and devotion to God.</LI></p>

<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Francis was initially cautious about Anthony’s education, fearing it could lead to pride, but he approved Anthony teaching theology as long as it didn’t interfere with prayer and devotion. Anthony taught at a friary in Bologna, using the Bible as the primary text, and his sermons heavily referenced Scripture. While continuing to preach, he took on greater leadership roles and became the provincial superior of northern Italy in 1226. In 1228, he met Pope Gregory IX in Rome and delivered a sermon so powerful that it was compared to the miracle of Pentecost.</LI></p>

<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Padua, a major Italian city, was home to Anthony’s final years. Though he sought solitude at times, he remained dedicated to preaching and leadership. In poor health, he asked to be relieved of his duties but was later recalled for discussions on the Franciscan Rule. His final Lenten sermons in 1231 drew massive crowds, requiring open-air venues. Exhausted, he left Padua but wished to return before his death. Too weak to complete the journey, he died at Arcella at 36, having been a Franciscan for just 10 years. Pope Gregory IX canonized him a year later, moved by the miracles at his tomb. Known for his humility, courage, and deep devotion, Anthony remains a beloved saint of the people.</LI></p>

<p>
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tradition of invoking St. Anthony’s help in finding lost or stolen items originates from an incident in his life. A novice who had left the Franciscan Order stole Anthony’s precious psalter, which contained his teaching notes. After Anthony prayed, the novice was compelled to return both the book and himself to the Order. This event led to the belief in St. Anthony’s intercession for lost items.

The practice of St. Anthony Bread involves giving alms in gratitude for answered prayers. One legend traces it back to a mother in 1263 who promised to donate corn for the poor if her drowned child was restored—and he was. Another account involves Louise Bouffier, a French shopkeeper, whose stuck door miraculously opened after she prayed to St. Anthony and promised to give bread to the poor. These stories led to the tradition of St. Anthony Bread as a charitable practice.</LI></p>

<p>
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Anthony has been depicted in various artistic ways, including holding a book, a lily, or a torch, preaching to fish, or holding the Blessed Sacrament before a mule. Since the 17th century, he is most commonly shown with the child Jesus, inspired by a story where Jesus appeared to him as a child in a brilliant light, witnessed by the Lord of Chatenauneuf.

Similar to St. Francis, Anthony was deeply moved by Christ’s humility, seeing poverty as a way to imitate Jesus. He is also the patron saint of sailors and travelers, likely due to his own extensive missionary journeys. Legends connect him to miraculous guidance and protection at sea, including stories of a Franciscan priest calming a storm with relics of St. Anthony and two sisters being guided by a mysterious young man, later believed to be Anthony himself.</LI></p>

<p>
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Anthony is celebrated as an exceptional teacher and preacher within the Franciscan Order. He was the first officially approved teacher of the Franciscans, earning the title “Hammer of Heretics” for his powerful preaching. He was also known for his efforts in peacemaking and justice.

When canonizing him in 1232, Pope Gregory IX called him the “Ark of the Testament” and the “Repository of Holy Scripture.” Often depicted with a burning light or Scripture, he was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. The Church encourages people to imitate Anthony’s love for God’s word, his wisdom, and his dedication to living out Christ’s humility and goodness.</LI></p>
